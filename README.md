# Spring boot MVC

This is my first Spring boot MVC project. Here I made a CRUD of products where I made simple operations for creating, updating, deleting and show registres in a view.

Thymeleaf is the template engine I used to represent server values on html view. 

And the database management system that I use, is H2.
